# TwapsClient

A macOS app for loading and displaying Twaps (The Web for Apps).

## Overview

TwapsClient is part of the Twaps ecosystem, which brings web-like dynamics to native macOS applications. This client component is responsible for:

- Loading Twaps from a TwapsServer
- Compiling Twaps into dynamic libraries
- Displaying Twaps in a native macOS interface

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Project

**Note:** This is an experimental project created to explore the concept of dynamic native UI modules. It is not intended for production use at this stage. The code is shared to inspire discussion and collaboration around the idea of bringing web-like dynamics to native app development.

## Features

- Simple URL-based Twap loading
- Dynamic compilation of Twaps
- Native SwiftUI interface
